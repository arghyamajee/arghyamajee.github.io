Welcome! I am a scientist at the [Institute Theory of Polymers](https://www.ipfdd.de/en/research/institute-theory-of-polymers/) of [Leibniz Institute of Polymer Research Dresden](https://www.ipfdd.de/en/home). My research focuses on building models for bio-soft matter systems at a mesoscopic level to understand phenomena occurring at microscopic level. To this end, I often rely on phenomenological descriptions. To know more about my previous and current research interests, please navigate to the 'Research' tab.

I also have a growing interest in data science and my extensive experience of energy minimization and nonlinear optimization naturally make me interested in machine and deep learning approaches applied to bio-soft matter systems.

In case any of the above matches your interest, I would love to talk more about it.
