I am a scientist at the [Institute Theory of Polymers](https://www.ipfdd.de/en/research/institute-theory-of-polymers/) of [Leibniz Institute of Polymer Research Dresden](https://www.ipfdd.de/en/home). My work focuses on modeling bio-soft matter systems at the mesoscopic scale to gain insight into microscopic phenomena. I often use phenomenological approaches to bridge these scales. For more details on my previous and current research, please navigate to the 'Research' tab.

My work also intersects with data science — leveraging my background in nonlinear optimization, I explore machine and deep learning applications in soft matter systems. One ongoing project involves predicting nucleation patterns in undercooled polymer melts using CNNs.

If any of this resonates with your interests, I’d be glad to connect and discuss further.
