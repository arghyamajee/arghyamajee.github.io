I perform theoretical and computational research in the inter-disciplinary field of Soft Condensed Matter Physics. To be more specific, my interests include electrostatics in liquids and in colloidal suspensions, charge-regulation of colloids and biomolecules, capillary and interfacial phenomena, thermophoresis of charged colloids, Seebeck effect in complex fluids, liquid-liquid phase separation, classical density functional theory, self-propulsion of active colloids. Below you can find more about my contributions to these topics. In terms of methodology, while my PhD thesis work was mostly analytical, my postdoctoral and subsequent research involved a lot of numerical computation using C++, Python, shooting method like RK4, finite element method, and in many cases, I followed an approach based on the classical density functional theory (DFT).

### Biological condensates

Macroions like DNA, RNA or proteins, need to find each other in specific cellular compartments in order to prevent uncontrolled and harmful interference between themselves. These compartments can have a fixed physical structure, like the membrane surrounding the cell, or exhibit only a temporary, fleeting existence by forming, dispersing and reforming under the varying requirements of the cellular life cycle. We have investigated the role of electrostatics in the formation and functioning of such condensates. Using a newly formulated binary cell model we showed how charge symmetry breaking of neighboring macroions can lead to the formation of condensates. This new line of thinking enriches the options biomolecular systems have to generate complex, functional assemblies in the cell, even if at first sight this seems to contradict the common assumptions. We have also developed an electro-thermodynamic theory of protein condensates which suggests formation of multiple charged layers around the condensate surface and a nonmonotonic variation of the associated electrostatic potential profiles. Our results have the potential to impact the diffusion of single molecules across the interface as well as account for a varying tendency of droplets to fuse and are expected to be useful for understanding the electrophoretic motion of droplets.

### Charge-regulation of colloids and biomolecules

![Charge_regulation](/assets/img/Charge_regulation.jpeg){: width="500" style="float:right; padding-left:20px" }

Colloids including biomolecules in electrolyte solutions respond to the change in their environment (e.g., separation distance or pH of the solution) and automatically adjust their surface charge accordingly. This is known as surface charge regulation. While considering charge-regulated chemically identical surfaces, the charge densities have always been considered to be equal on these surfaces. However, without assuming the surface charge densities a priori, we minimized the relevant thermodynamic potential which yields the equilibrium state of the system, without any additional assumptions. Our study reveals that, depending upon the parameters of the system, interacting surfaces can indeed become differently charged both in magnitude as well as in sign. This fundamental concept can have important implications in plant thylakoid membranes, in coacervation of macromolecules or in vesicles surrounded by lipid bilayer membranes.

### Colloids at electrolyte interfaces

![Interface](/assets/img/Interface.jpeg){: width="250" style="float:right; padding-left:20px" }

Self-assembly of colloidal particles at electrolyte (e.g., oil-water) interfaces finds application in many biological and industrial processes including membrane-protein interaction, formation of inorganic protocells, stabilization of emulsions including food emulsions, water purification, and oil recovery. Most of the previous studies in this context have exclusively dealt with the large separation between the particles where the repulsive part of the interaction can be compared to a dipole-dipole interaction. We focused on the less studied case short-separation between particles. Among others, one of our striking results is that the interaction between the three-phase contact lines can be strong enough for typical experimental setups and that it can generate attractive interaction between likely charged particles!

### Thermoelectric effect in colloidal suspensions

![Seebeck](/assets/img/Seebeck.jpeg){: width="250" style="float:right; padding-left:20px" }

When a temperature gradient is present across an electrolyte solution, the ions of the solution start moving due to their temperature dependent solvation energies. In general, the velocity of one type of ion differs from another. As a result, one observes a charge separation and a macroscopic electric field which is proportional to the thermal gradient. When colloidal particles are placed in this external temperature gradient, both the temperature and the thermoelectric field acts on the particle leading to a collective thermoelectrophoretic motion. Our proposed mechanism provided explanations for the experimentally observed dependencies of particle velocity on the colloidal volume fraction or on the molecular weight of polymers. We also showed that electrolyte Seebeck effect leads to charging of neutral colloids when they are heated, a net accumulation of charges at a hot spot in an electrolyte solution and at any heated metal nanostructures (e. g., the cap of an active Janus colloid in an electrolyte, or gold- coated interfaces in optofluidic devices).Â

### Self-propulsion of heated Janus particles

![Janus_dimer](/assets/img/Janus_dimer.jpeg){: width="200" style="float:right; padding-left:20px" }

Thermally active Janus particles (JPs) are colloids with two sides differing in their physical or chemical properties. These asymmetric particles generate their own gradient within an otherwise homogeneous medium and self-propel by converting the available energy into mechanical work. We addressed two issues: (i) how does the temperature field and the resulting flow pattern look in the vicinity of a heated metal-capped Janus Particle, and (ii) how to model the experimentally observed rotational movement of non-axisymmetric JPs.
