### Biological condensates
Macroions like DNA, RNA or proteins, need to find each other in specific cellular compartments in order to prevent uncontrolled and harmful interference between themselves. These can have a fixed physical structure, like the membrane surrounding the cell, or exhibit only a temporary, fleeting existence by forming, dispersing and reforming under the varying requirements of the cellular life cycle. One class of physical mechanisms which is widely accepted to be responsible for partitioning macroions in rearranging compartments is called liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). We have investigated the role of electrostatics in the formation and functioning of such condensates. A newly formulated binary cell model allowed us to study charge symmetry breaking of neighboring macroions induced by an interplay of macroion charge-regulation with electrostatic interactions and a density-functional calculation showed dominant two-particle configurations with alternating charge signs. This new line of thinking enriches the options biomolecular systems have to generate complex, functional assemblies in the cell, even if at first sight this seems to contradict the common assumptions. We have also developed an electro-thermodynamic theory of protein condensates. Our results suggest that multiple charged layers can form around the interface, where charge neutrality is locally not obeyed. Depending on the values of parameters, such charge profiles and associated electrostatic potential profiles imply either reflection or attraction of single molecules diffusing across the interface. They could also account for a varying tendency of droplets to fuse and are expected to be useful for understanding the electrophoretic motion of droplets.

### Charge-regulation of colloids and biomolecules
Colloids including biomolecules in electrolyte solutions respond to the change in their environment (e.g., separation distance or pH of the solution) and automatically adjust their surface
charge accordingly. This is known as surface charge regulation. While considering charge-regulated chemically identical surfaces, the charge densities have always been considered to be equal on these surfaces. However, without assuming the surface charge densities a priori, we minimized the relevant thermodynamic potential which yields the equilibrium state of the system, without any additional assumptions. Our study reveals that, depending upon the parameters of the system, interacting surfaces can indeed become differently charged both in magnitude as well as in sign. This fundamental concept can have important implications in plant thylakoid membranes, in coacervation of macromolecules or in vesicles surrounded by lipid bilayer membranes.
