### Charge-regulation of colloids and biomolecules
Colloids including biomolecules in electrolyte solutions respond to the change in their environment (e.g., separation distance or pH of the solution) and automatically adjust their surface
charge accordingly. This is known as surface charge regulation. While considering charge-regulated chemically identical surfaces, the charge densities have always been considered to be equal on these surfaces. However, without assuming the surface charge densities a priori, we minimized the relevant thermodynamic potential which yields the equilibrium state of the system, without any additional assumptions. Our study reveals that, depending upon the parameters of the system, interacting surfaces can indeed become differently charged both in magnitude as well as in sign. This fundamental concept can have important implications in plant thylakoid membranes, in coacervation of macromolecules or in vesicles surrounded by bilayer membranes.
